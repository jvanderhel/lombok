	<h1>Tired of checked exceptions?</h1>
	<p>
		This lombok spinoff project consists of a hack that only works in javac - not eclipse or any other IDE.<br />
		It will completely disable the notion of checked exceptions. You may throw any exception anywhere, and you may
		also catch any exception anywhere. In standard javac, you may not catch a checked exception that is not declared
		as thrown by at least 1 statement in your try block, unless it is <code>Exception</code> or <code>Throwable</code>.<br />
		This restriction is lifted as well.
	</p>
	<h3>Usage</h3>
	<p>
		Just make sure <code>disableCheckedExceptions-alpha.jar</code> is on the classpath as you compile. For example:<br />
		<code>javac -cp disableCheckedExceptions-alpha.jar MySource.java</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		Ready to try it out? download it here: <a href="downloads/disableCheckedExceptions-alpha.jar">disableCheckedExceptions-alpha.jar</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Want to know how its done? Grab the lombok repository <a href="http://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/tree/disableCheckedExceptions">here on github</a>,
		and look in the <code>experimental</code> directory.
