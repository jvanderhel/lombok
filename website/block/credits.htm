			We'd like to thank:<ul>
			<li>Perry Nguyen (pfn on ##java on freenode) for creating the inspiration for project lombok.</li>
			<li>Tor Norbye for some feedback on how Netbeans works internally. We haven't cracked the netbeans nut quite yet, and help is
				very welcome. Still, we've made some progress in adding netbeans support to Project Lombok thanks to Tor.</li>
				<li><a href="http://javaposse.com/">The Java Posse</a> for making the java community <em>awesome</em>. Listen to their podcast!</li>
				<li>Petr Jiricka for his help with netbeans and javac.</li>
			</ul>
			as well as the authors of the following tools that we use:<ul>
			<li><a href="http://code.google.com/">Google Code Hosting</a> for hosting our issue tracker as well as the lombok releases.</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> for hosting lombok's repository.</li>
			<li>The <a href="http://asm.ow2.org/index.html">ASM team</a> at ObjectWeb for creating an excellent class file editing tool.

				features pages.</li>
			<li><a href="http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody">Kroc Camen</a>'s video for everbody. The lombok demo video

			<li>Longtail Video's <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/jw-flv-player/">JWPlayer</a>, which is bringing the video to
				those of you who have an aging browser.</li>
			<li>The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spi/">spi project</a>, which makes it very easy to extend lombok with your own transformations.</li>
			<li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/">Apache Ivy</a> - Dependency management</li>
